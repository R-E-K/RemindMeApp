TODOs :

Next update :
- Config file (for keeping choice of dark or light theme)
- Better use of style.xml in xaml files
- Dark Theme

After :
- User is able to change language => It seems that it's very difficult to change app lang in runtime.
If it's the case, when user changes language, display a message that ask to the user to restart application
for apply this change.
- User language in config file

Not Sure :
- two tabs : first with oncoming reminders and second with past ones
